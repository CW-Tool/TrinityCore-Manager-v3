- Work on Item/Weapon/NPC/etc. creators
- Work on adding more TrinityCore console commands to the TCAction class
- Work on the "Find" forms
- Work on CreateSmartAI form
- Fix/Add form themes/controls
- Add more database methods 
- Add a 3D viewer for Items/Weapons/NPCs
- Add a Splash Screen on application startup
- Implement downloading and executing the databases in setup form (page for it already exists, needs actual implementation)

- New icon for the 'Settings' option menu
- Re-work all places where we use a combobox to store a lot of data (showing online characters in a combobox is not going to work out for big servers)

- Figure out why the console stops logging the worldserver's actions (on W7 (?only?)) after a short period of time
- Create log folder for crash dumps, so that users can send us crash dumps (via Bug Report form) with respective crash info attached and/or copy/pasted.
